# 1. Create a function called number_shares_a() that only accepts an investment amount and returns the number of shares of Fund A which that investment could buy today.
# Then call the function with two different amounts to ensure that it works properly.


# 2. Create a more-general function called number_shares() that takes in an investment amount and a fund. It should return the number of shares of that fund which that investment could buy today.
# Then call the function with different amounts and different funds.


# 3. Create a more flexible calculator method called history_shares() that takes in an investment amount, fund, and year and returns the number of shares that money could buy in that year.



### Advanced Bonus Challenge ###

# 4. What is the change of an investment over time? Create a method calculate_profit() that accepts an initial investment amount, the fund, and the initial investment year, and returns the current profit made on the initial investment. This is an open ended one - there are many ways to do this!



# Bonus: Format the output of the function as USD currency, so instead of 1000, the function should output $1000.00.



### Double Advanced Bonus Challenge ###

# 5. Which investment is the best? Create a method best_choice() that accepts an investment amount and a year, and returns the name of the fund that would have made the most money for the investor.



# Bonus: In addition to the name of the fund, also return how much money the investor would have earned.



### Triple Advanced Bonus Challenge ###

# 6. Consider the current profit difference between making an investment in a fund several years apart. Create a method investment_diff() that accepts an investment amount, a fund, and two year values and returns the current profit difference if the money had been made earlier vs. later.



# Bonus: How can you account for a sloppy investment advisor who puts the years in a different order than you expect?
